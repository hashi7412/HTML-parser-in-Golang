# HTML-parser-in-Golang

Package goquery implements features similar to jQuery, including the chainable syntax, to manipulate and query an HTML document.

It brings a syntax and a set of features similar to jQuery to the Go language. It is based on Go's net/html package and the CSS Selector library cascadia. Syntax-wise, it is as close as possible to jQuery, with the same method names when possible, and that warm and fuzzy chainable interface.
